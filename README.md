## Examples

Here are some examples of what you can achieve with **WidgetAnimation**:

### Example 1: Simple Fade Animation

This example demonstrates how to create a simple fade animation for a widget.

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct FadeWidget: Widget {
    var body: some WidgetConfiguration {
        StaticConfiguration(kind: "FadeWidget", provider: Provider()) { entry in
            FadeView(entry: entry)
        }
        .configurationDisplayName("Fade Widget")
        .description("This widget fades in and out.")
    }
}

struct FadeView: View {
    var entry: Provider.Entry

    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello, Widget!")
            .transition(.opacity)
            .animation(.easeInOut(duration: 1.0))
    }
}
```

### Example 2: Bounce Animation

This example shows how to create a bounce effect.

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct BounceWidget: Widget {
    var body: some WidgetConfiguration {
        StaticConfiguration(kind: "BounceWidget", provider: Provider()) { entry in
            BounceView(entry: entry)
        }
        .configurationDisplayName("Bounce Widget")
        .description("This widget bounces.")
    }
}

struct BounceView: View {
    var entry: Provider.Entry

    var body: some View {
        Text("Bounce!")
            .scaleEffect(1.2)
            .animation(Animation.easeInOut(duration: 0.5).repeatForever(autoreverses: true))
    }
}
```
